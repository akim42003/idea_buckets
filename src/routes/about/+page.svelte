	About this blog; I made a similar situation for my own internal thoughts but it became difficult
	to maintain due to some bad programming decisions and also I want to write about different things
	in different places. So far, it's my working reading list (goodreads advertises too much) and a
	few cobbled together essays. I'm hoping to organize this better one day, and use it as a
	repository of thought pieces/informal writings and technical notes. For now I'm having fun writing
	again.
